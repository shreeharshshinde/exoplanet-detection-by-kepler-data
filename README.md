### Exoplanet Discovery with Python and Kepler Data

## Overview & Intent

This project is a complete, end-to-end walkthrough of the process of discovering an exoplanet using publicly available data from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. My intent was to demystify the world of computational astrophysics and show how, with the right tools and a bit of persistence, anyone can replicate the fundamental steps of a real astronomical discovery.

This repository doesn't just show the final, perfect code. It's the result of a real-world journey that involved understanding the science, writing the code, and persevering through challenging debugging sessions—from mysterious algorithm failures to subtle library version conflicts. The goal is to create a resource that is both a practical guide to the **Python code** and a clear explanation of the **astrophysics** that powers our search.

## Features

This repository contains several key components:

* **`The_Complete_Kepler-10b_Discovery_Notebook.ipynb`**: The main, fully-documented Jupyter Notebook that tells the complete story of finding and characterizing the rocky exoplanet Kepler-10b.

* **`WASP-18b_Code_Only_Notebook.ipynb`**: A validation notebook used to test the analysis pipeline on a different target (a "hot Jupiter") using data from the TESS telescope.

* **`survey_pipeline.ipynb`**: An advanced notebook that scales up the project into an automated survey to search for planets around multiple stars.

## Core Concepts Covered

* **Astrophysics**: The Transit Method, Light Curves, Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion.

* **Data Science**: Data acquisition, cleaning (outlier removal, flattening), signal processing, and visualization.

* **Python Libraries**: `lightkurve`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `astroquery`.

* **Algorithms**: The Box-Least Squares (BLS) periodogram for finding periodic signals.
